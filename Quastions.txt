DATA: https://www.rijdendetreinen.nl/en/open-data/disruptions
is there a pathern of disruptions in the trein trafic within the NS? 
	what is a pathern?
	what does the NS mean with a disruption?
	what is included/exclude in train trafic? 
	who is the NS? 


Why must we do it?
	so, we can mitagate or prevent more train disruptions.

What is it exactly what we are going to do?
	We are going to look for connections between the disruptions and the weather and time of year.

Who is going to what?
	In my personal project i will do most of the work.

When are we going to do it?
	as soon as posable I hope. 

How are we going to do it (means, resources, finances)?
	first look for datasets that can be overlapped to see the corelation between the sets, then we overlay them to see if the weather has a play in it. then we add the time of year to see if that adds a diference.
